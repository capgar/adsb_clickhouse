# Kafka Client TLS Certificates
# 
# This file is an EXAMPLE. Copy it to 00-secrets-kafka-tls.yaml and populate with your certificates.
# 00-secrets-kafka-tls.yaml is gitignored.
#
# These are the Cloudflare-signed client certificates used for mTLS authentication to Kafka.
# The same client keypair is used across all ClickHouse deployments.
#
# To create base64 values from your certificate files:
#   base64 -w 0 ca.crt
#   base64 -w 0 client.crt  
#   base64 -w 0 client.key
#
# These certificates must match those trusted by the Kafka broker's truststore.
